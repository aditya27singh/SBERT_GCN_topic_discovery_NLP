Transformer models, exemplified by BERT, have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. This research scrutinizes the current landscape of AI in education, emphasizing the utilization of transformer models. Specifically, the research delves into the influence of AI tools facilitating text generation through input prompts, with a notable instance being the GPT-4 model developed by OpenAI. The study employs pre-trained transformer models to discern whether a given text originates from AI or human sources. Notably, BERT emerges as the most effective model, fine-tuned using a dataset comprising abstracts authored by humans and those generated by AI. The outcomes reveal a heightened accuracy in distinguishing AI-generated text. These findings bear significance for the educational realm, suggesting that while endorsing the use of such tools for learning, vigilance is warranted to identify potential misuse or instances where students should independently develop their reasoning skills. Nevertheless, ethical considerations must be paramount when employing such methodologies. We have highlighted vulnerabilities concerning the potential bias of AI models towards non-native English speakers, stemming from possible deficiencies in vocabulary and grammatical structure. Additionally, users must ensure that there is no complete reliance on these systems to ascertain students' performance. Further research is imperative to unleash the full potential of AI in education and address ethical considerations tied to its application.","Unleashing the transformers: NLP models detect AI writing in education.Artificial Intelligence (AI) has witnessed widespread application across diverse domains, with education being a prominent focus for enhancing learning outcomes and tailoring educational approaches.

However, current deep learning-based phishing detection applications do not apply to mobile devices due to the computational burden. We propose a lightweight phishing detection algorithm that distinguishes phishing from legitimate websites solely from URLs to be used in mobile devices. As a baseline performance, we apply Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to URL-based and HTML-based website features. A model search results in 15 ANN models with accuracies >96%, comparable to state-of-the-art approaches. Next, we test the performance of deep ANNs on URLbased features only; however, all models perform poorly with the highest accuracy of 86.2%, indicating that URL-based features alone are not adequate to detect phishing websites even with deep ANNs. Since language transformers learn to represent context-dependent text sequences, we hypothesize that they will be able to learn directly from the text in URLs to distinguish between legitimate and malicious websites. We apply three state-of-the-art deep transformers (BERT, ELECTRA, and RoBERTa) for phishing detection. Testing custom and standard vocabularies, we find that pre-trained transformers available for immediate use (with fine-tuning) outperform the model trained with the custom URL-based vocabulary. In addition, we test a thinner BERT transformer which is suitable for lightweight devices like mobiles, called MobileBERT. Our results emphasize that evaluation metrics of this model are competitive to other models in this study, yet the testing time is significantly less, making this model a choice for embedding phishing detection algorithms in mobile phones. Using pre-trained transformers to predict phishing websites from only URLs has five advantages: 1) requires little training time (230 to 320 s), 2) is more easily updatable than feature-based approaches because no pre-processing of URLs is required, 3) is safer to use because phishing websites can be predicted without physically visiting the malicious sites, 4) is easily deployable for real-time detection and is applicable to run on mobile devices, and 5) using a mobile specific transformer yields comparable performance and predicts 3 times faster than the other transformer models in this study.","Towards Performance of NLP Transformers on URL-Based Phishing Detection for Mobile Devices.Hackers are increasingly launching phishing attacks via SMS and social media.

The relevant notion of smoothness then corresponds to continuity in terms of the Wasserstein distance between these contexts. We demonstrate that deep transformers are universal and can approximate continuous in-context mappings to arbitrary precision, uniformly over compact token domains. A key aspect of our results, compared to existing findings, is that for a fixed precision, a single transformer can operate on an arbitrary (even infinite) number of tokens. Additionally, it operates with a fixed embedding dimension of tokens (this dimension does not increase with precision) and a fixed number of heads (proportional to the dimension). The use of MLPs between multi-head attention layers is also explicitly controlled.

We demonstrate that deep transformers are universal and can approximate continuous in-context mappings to arbitrary precision, uniformly over compact token domains. A key aspect of our results, compared to existing findings, is that for a fixed precision, a single transformer can operate on an arbitrary (even infinite) number of tokens. Additionally, it operates with a fixed embedding dimension of tokens (this dimension does not increase with precision) and a fixed number of heads (proportional to the dimension). The use of MLPs between multi-head attention layers is also explicitly controlled. We consider both unmasked attentions (as used for the vision transformer) and masked causal attentions (as used for NLP and time series applications). We tackle the causal setting leveraging a space-time lifting to analyze causal attention as a mapping over probability distributions of tokens.",-23.555063,2.5940053,1

In this work, we present a simple and effective approach to compress large Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) based pre-trained models, termed as deep self-attention distillation. The small model (student) is trained by deeply mimicking the self-attention module, which plays a vital role in Transformer networks, of the large model (teacher).

Furthermore, we introduce the scaled dot-product between values in the self-attention module as the new deep self-attention knowledge, in addition to the attention distributions (i.e., the scaled dot-product of queries and keys) that have been used in existing works. Moreover, we show that introducing a teacher assistant (Mirzadeh et al., 2019) also helps the distillation of large pre-trained Transformer models. Experimental results demonstrate that our monolingual model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in different parameter size of student models.

Instead, directly parameterizing by $W$ minimizes a Frobenius norm objective. We characterize this convergence, highlighting that it can occur toward locally-optimal directions rather than global ones.

Importantly, we show that over-parameterization catalyzes global convergence by ensuring the feasibility of the SVM problem and by guaranteeing a benign optimization landscape devoid of stationary points.

Inspired by such significant achievements, some pioneering works have recently been done on employing Transformer-liked architectures in the computer vision (CV) field, which have demonstrated their effectiveness on three fundamental CV tasks (classification, detection, and segmentation) as well as multiple sensory data stream (images, point clouds, and vision-language data). Because of their competitive modeling capabilities, the visual Transformers have achieved impressive performance improvements over multiple benchmarks as compared with modern convolution neural networks (CNNs). In this survey, we have reviewed over 100 of different visual Transformers comprehensively according to three fundamental CV tasks and different data stream types, where taxonomy is proposed to organize the representative methods according to their motivations, structures, and application scenarios. Because of their differences on training settings and dedicated vision tasks, we have also evaluated and compared all these existing visual Transformers under different configurations.

Inspired by such significant achievements, some pioneering works have recently been done on employing Transformer-liked architectures in the computer vision (CV) field, which have demonstrated their effectiveness on three fundamental CV tasks (classification, detection, and segmentation) as well as multiple sensory data stream (images, point clouds, and vision-language data). Because of their competitive modeling capabilities, the visual Transformers have achieved impressive performance improvements over multiple benchmarks as compared with modern convolution neural networks (CNNs). In this survey, we have reviewed over 100 of different visual Transformers comprehensively according to three fundamental CV tasks and different data stream types, where taxonomy is proposed to organize the representative methods according to their motivations, structures, and application scenarios. Because of their differences on training settings and dedicated vision tasks, we have also evaluated and compared all these existing visual Transformers under different configurations. Furthermore, we have revealed a series of essential but unexploited aspects that may empower such visual Transformers to stand out from numerous architectures, e.g., slack high-level semantic embeddings to bridge the gap between the visual Transformers and the sequential ones.

The purpose of this study was to demonstrate a proof-of-concept study for predicting case duration by applying natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning that interpret radiology reports for patients undergoing radius fracture repair. Methods Logistic regression, random forest, and feedforward neural networks were tested without NLP and with bag-of-words. Another NLP method tested used feedforward neural networks and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers specifically pre-trained on clinical notes (ClinicalBERT). A total of 201 cases were included. The data were split into 70% training and 30% test sets. The average root mean squared error (RMSE) were calculated (and 95% confidence interval [CI]) from 10-fold cross-validation on the training set. The models were then tested on the test set to determine proportion of times surgical cases would have scheduled accurately if ClinicalBERT was implemented versus historic averages. Results The average RMSE was lowest using feedforward neural networks using outputs from ClinicalBERT (25.6 min, 95% CI: 21.5–29.7), which was significantly (P < 0.001) lower than the baseline model (39.3 min, 95% CI: 30.9–47.7). Using the feedforward neural network and ClinicalBERT on the test set, the percentage of accurately predicted cases, which was defined by the actual surgical duration within 15% of the predicted surgical duration, increased from 26.8 to 58.9% (P < 0.001). Conclusion This proof-of-concept study demonstrated the successful application of NLP and machine leaning to extract features from unstructured clinical data resulting in improved prediction accuracy for surgical case duration.","Improving case duration accuracy of orthopedic surgery using bidirectional encoder representations from Transformers (BERT) on Radiology Reports.Purpose A major source of inefficiency in the operating room is the mismatch between scheduled versus actual surgical time.

However, annotating each person with a point is an expensive and laborious process. During the testing phase, the point-level annotations are not considered to evaluate the counting accuracy, which means the point-level annotations are redundant. Hence, it is desirable to develop weakly-supervised counting methods that just rely on count-level annotations, a more economical way of labeling. Current weakly-supervised counting methods adopt the CNN to regress a total count of the crowd by an image-to-count paradigm. However, having limited receptive fields for context modeling is an intrinsic limitation of these weakly-supervised CNN-based methods. These methods thus cannot achieve satisfactory performance, with limited applications in the real world. The transformer is a popular sequence-to-sequence prediction model in natural language processing (NLP), which contains a global receptive field. In this paper, we propose TransCrowd, which reformulates the weakly-supervised crowd counting problem from the perspective of sequence-to-count based on transformers. We observe that the proposed TransCrowd can effectively extract the semantic crowd information by using the self-attention mechanism of transformer. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to adopt a pure transformer for crowd counting research. Experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed TransCrowd achieves superior performance compared with all the weakly-supervised CNN-based counting methods and gains highly competitive counting performance compared with some popular fully-supervised counting methods.","TransCrowd: weakly-supervised crowd counting with transformers.The mainstream crowd counting methods usually utilize the convolution neural network (CNN) to regress a density map, requiring point-level annotations. However, annotating each person with a point is an expensive and laborious process. During the testing phase, the point-level annotations are not considered to evaluate the counting accuracy, which means the point-level annotations are redundant. Hence, it is desirable to develop weakly-supervised counting methods that just rely on count-level annotations, a more economical way of labeling. Current weakly-supervised counting methods adopt the CNN to regress a total count of the crowd by an image-to-count paradigm. However, having limited receptive fields for context modeling is an intrinsic limitation of these weakly-supervised CNN-based methods.

In this task, the model needs to detect objects and predict visual relationships between them. Most of the existing models predict relationships in parallel assuming their independence. While there are different ways to capture these dependencies, we explore a conditional approach motivated by the sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) formalism. Different from the previous research, our proposed model predicts visual relationships one at a time in an autoregressive manner by explicitly conditioning on the already predicted relationships. Drawing from translation models in NLP, we propose an encoder-decoder model built using Transformers where the encoder captures global context and long range interactions. The decoder then makes sequential predictions by conditioning on the scene graph constructed so far. In addition, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning-based training strategy tailored to Seq2Seq scene graph generation.

In this task, the model needs to detect objects and predict visual relationships between them. Most of the existing models predict relationships in parallel assuming their independence. While there are different ways to capture these dependencies, we explore a conditional approach motivated by the sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) formalism. Different from the previous research, our proposed model predicts visual relationships one at a time in an autoregressive manner by explicitly conditioning on the already predicted relationships. Drawing from translation models in NLP, we propose an encoder-decoder model built using Transformers where the encoder captures global context and long range interactions. The decoder then makes sequential predictions by conditioning on the scene graph constructed so far. In addition, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning-based training strategy tailored to Seq2Seq scene graph generation.

The goal of this study is to explore transformer-based models (eg, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers [BERT]) for clinical concept extraction and develop an open-source package with pretrained clinical models to facilitate concept extraction and other downstream natural language processing (NLP) tasks in the medical domain.


METHODS
We systematically explored 4 widely used transformer-based architectures, including BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT, and ELECTRA, for extracting various types of clinical concepts using 3 public datasets from the 2010 and 2012 i2b2 challenges and the 2018 n2c2 challenge. We examined general transformer models pretrained using general English corpora as well as clinical transformer models pretrained using a clinical corpus and compared them with a long short-term memory conditional random fields (LSTM-CRFs) mode as a baseline. Furthermore, we integrated the 4 clinical transformer-based models into an open-source package.


RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The RoBERTa-MIMIC model achieved state-of-the-art performance on 3 public clinical concept extraction datasets with F1-scores of 0.8994, 0.8053, and 0.8907, respectively. Compared to the baseline LSTM-CRFs model, RoBERTa-MIMIC remarkably improved the F1-score by approximately 4% and 6% on the 2010 and 2012 i2b2 datasets.

In this work, we challenge the commonly held belief in deep learning that going deeper is better, and show an alternative design approach that is building wider attention Transformers. We demonstrate that wide single layer Transformer models can compete with or outperform deeper ones in a variety of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks when both are trained from scratch. The impact of changing the model aspect ratio on Transformers is then studied systematically. This ratio balances the number of layers and the number of attention heads per layer while keeping the total number of attention heads and all other hyperparameters constant. On average, across 4 NLP tasks and 10 attention types, single layer wide models perform 0.3% better than their deep counterparts. We show an in-depth evaluation and demonstrate how wide models require a far smaller memory footprint and can run faster on commodity hardware, in addition, these wider models are also more interpretable. For example, a single layer Transformer on the IMDb byte level text classification has 3.1x faster inference latency on a CPU than its equally accurate deeper counterpart, and is half the size. We therefore put forward wider and shallower models as a viable and desirable alternative for small models on NLP tasks, and as an important area of research for domains beyond this.","Wide Attention Is The Way Forward For Transformers.The Transformer is an extremely powerful and prominent deep learning architecture. In this work, we challenge the commonly held belief in deep learning that going deeper is better, and show an alternative design approach that is building wider attention Transformers. We demonstrate that wide single layer Transformer models can compete with or outperform deeper ones in a variety of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks when both are trained from scratch. The impact of changing the model aspect ratio on Transformers is then studied systematically. This ratio balances the number of layers and the number of attention heads per layer while keeping the total number of attention heads and all other hyperparameters constant.

Objective We aim to investigate the effectiveness of BERT-based models for biomedical or clinical entity normalization. In addition, our second objective is to investigate whether the domains of training data influence the performances of BERT-based models as well as the degree of influence. Methods Our data was comprised of 1.5 million unlabeled electronic health record (EHR) notes. We first fine-tuned BioBERT on this large collection of unlabeled EHR notes.

Natural language processing (NLP) has been shown to help identify free-text radiology reports including actionable findings. However, the application of recent deep learning techniques to radiology reports, which can improve the detection performance, has not been thoroughly examined. Moreover, free-text that clinicians input in the ordering form (order information) has seldom been used to identify actionable reports. This study aims to evaluate the benefits of two new approaches: (1) bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), a recent deep learning architecture in NLP, and (2) using order information in addition to radiology reports. Methods We performed a binary classification to distinguish actionable reports (i.e., radiology reports tagged as actionable in actual radiological practice) from non-actionable ones (those without an actionable tag). 90,923 Japanese radiology reports in our hospital were used, of which 788 (0.87%) were actionable. We evaluated four methods, statistical machine learning with logistic regression (LR) and with gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), and deep learning with a bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) model and a publicly available Japanese BERT model. Each method was used with two different inputs, radiology reports alone and pairs of order information and radiology reports. Thus, eight experiments were conducted to examine the performance. Results Without order information, BERT achieved the highest area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.5138, which showed a statistically significant improvement over LR, GBDT, and LSTM, and the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.9516. Simply coupling the order information with the radiology reports slightly increased the AUPRC of BERT but did not lead to a statistically significant improvement. This may be due to the complexity of clinical decisions made by radiologists. Conclusions BERT was assumed to be useful to detect actionable reports. More sophisticated methods are required to use order information effectively.","Automatic detection of actionable radiology reports using bidirectional encoder representations from transformers.Background It is essential for radiologists to communicate actionable findings to the referring clinicians reliably.

We built CairoDep, a set of models and a benchmark dataset for this purpose. First, we built CairoDep v1.0 dataset, a labeled dataset of 7000 posts including 3400 normal (non-depressed) posts and 3600 depressed posts. Our dataset was collected from multiple sources, specifically crowdsourcing, Arabic mental health forums and pages, readily available datasets and translation from English datasets. Second, we further trained two pre-trained BERT transformers for Arabic language to detect depression from Arabic posts in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and dialectic Arabic, namely ARABERT and MARBERT. We further trained and evaluated them on the dataset using 80%-20% split. We achieved accuracy, precision, recall and F1-Score values of 96.93%, 96.92%, 96.93% and 96.92% for ARABERT and of 96.07%, 96.11%, 96.04% and 96.07% for MARBERT respectively. These results are quite superior to the results reported in the literature for depression detection using lexicon analysis or traditional machine learning techniques. They open the door for deploying NLP transformers to develop mental health AI-powered applications and platforms for Arabic speakers.

Additionally, we modify the task-specific attention to incorporate the pruning scores. The two transformers are jointly trained by optimizing the task-specific loss. We run experiments on three benchmarks, including entailment and question-answering. We show that for a small drop of accuracy, DoT improves training and inference time by at least 50%.

Objective The aim of our study was to apply a deep learning model and rule-based natural language processing (NLP) method to identify evidences for liver cancer diagnosis automatically. Methods We proposed a pretrained, fine-tuned BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)-based BiLSTM-CRF (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory-Conditional Random Field) model to recognize the phrases of APHE (hyperintense enhancement in the arterial phase) and PDPH (hypointense in the portal and delayed phases).

People these days often fall prey to fake news that is in line with their perception. Checking the authenticity of news articles manually is a time-consuming and laborious task, thus, giving rise to the requirement for automated computational tools that can provide insights about degree of fake ness for news articles. In this paper, a Natural Language Processing (NLP) based mechanism is proposed to combat this challenge of classifying news articles as either fake or real.

People these days often fall prey to fake news that is in line with their perception. Checking the authenticity of news articles manually is a time-consuming and laborious task, thus, giving rise to the requirement for automated computational tools that can provide insights about degree of fake ness for news articles. In this paper, a Natural Language Processing (NLP) based mechanism is proposed to combat this challenge of classifying news articles as either fake or real.

This is different than batch normalization (BN), which is widely-adopted in Computer Vision. The preferred use of LN in NLP is principally due to the empirical observation that a (naive/vanilla) use of BN leads to significant performance degradation for NLP tasks; however, a thorough understanding of the underlying reasons for this is not always evident. In this paper, we perform a systematic study of NLP transformer models to understand why BN has a poor performance, as compared to LN. We find that the statistics of NLP data across the batch dimension exhibit large fluctuations throughout training. This results in instability, if BN is naively implemented. To address this, we propose Power Normalization (PN), a novel normalization scheme that resolves this issue by (i) relaxing zero-mean normalization in BN, (ii) incorporating a running quadratic mean instead of per batch statistics to stabilize fluctuations, and (iii) using an approximate backpropagation for incorporating the running statistics in the forward pass. We show theoretically, under mild assumptions, that PN leads to a smaller Lipschitz constant for the loss, compared with BN. Furthermore, we prove that the approximate backpropagation scheme leads to bounded gradients. We extensively test PN for transformers on a range of NLP tasks, and we show that it significantly outperforms both LN and BN. In particular, PN outperforms LN by 0.4/0.6 BLEU on IWSLT14/WMT14 and 5.6/3.0 PPL on PTB/WikiText-103.","Rethinking Batch Normalization in Transformers.The standard normalization method for neural network (NN) models used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) is layer normalization (LN).

This paper presents and discusses a literature review exploring how Natural Language Processing (NLP) has been applied to occurrence reports within safety-critical industries, informing further research on the topic and highlighting common challenges. Some of the uses of NLP include the ability for occurrence reports to be automatically classified against categories, and entities such as causes and consequences to be extracted from the text as well as the semantic searching of occurrence databases. The review revealed that machine learning models form the dominant method when applying NLP, although rule-based algorithms still provide a viable option for some entity extraction tasks. Recent advances in deep learning models such as Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding are now achieving a high accuracy while eliminating the need to substantially pre-process text. The construction of safety-themed datasets would be of benefit for the application of NLP to occurrence reporting, as this would allow the fine-tuning of current language models to safety tasks. An interesting approach is the use of topic modelling, which represents a shift away from the prescriptive classification taxonomies, splitting data into “topics”.

It is anticipated that NLP will soon become a mainstream tool used by safety practitioners to efficiently process and gain knowledge from safety-related text.","A Scoping Literature Review of Natural Language Processing Application to Safety Occurrence Reports.Safety occurrence reports can contain valuable information on how incidents occur, revealing knowledge that can assist safety practitioners. This paper presents and discusses a literature review exploring how Natural Language Processing (NLP) has been applied to occurrence reports within safety-critical industries, informing further research on the topic and highlighting common challenges. Some of the uses of NLP include the ability for occurrence reports to be automatically classified against categories, and entities such as causes and consequences to be extracted from the text as well as the semantic searching of occurrence databases. The review revealed that machine learning models form the dominant method when applying NLP, although rule-based algorithms still provide a viable option for some entity extraction tasks. Recent advances in deep learning models such as Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding are now achieving a high accuracy while eliminating the need to substantially pre-process text. The construction of safety-themed datasets would be of benefit for the application of NLP to occurrence reporting, as this would allow the fine-tuning of current language models to safety tasks. An interesting approach is the use of topic modelling, which represents a shift away from the prescriptive classification taxonomies, splitting data into “topics”. Where many papers focus on the computational accuracy of models, they would also benefit from real-world trials to further inform usefulness. It is anticipated that NLP will soon become a mainstream tool used by safety practitioners to efficiently process and gain knowledge from safety-related text.",-19.160366,-26.091795,0

Generative large language models (LLMs) are a subset of transformers-based neural network architecture models. LLMs have successfully leveraged a combination of an increased number of parameters, improvements in computational efficiency, and large pre-training datasets to perform a wide spectrum of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Using a few examples (few-shot) or no examples (zero-shot) for prompt-tuning has enabled LLMs to achieve state-of-the-art performance in a broad range of NLP applications. This article by the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) NLP Working Group characterizes the opportunities, challenges, and best practices for our community to leverage and advance the integration of LLMs in downstream NLP applications effectively. This can be accomplished through a variety of approaches, including augmented prompting, instruction prompt tuning, and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).

Traditional recommender systems rely on collaborative filtering or content-based filtering to make recommendations. However, these approaches have limitations, such as the cold start and the data sparsity problem. This survey paper presents an in-depth analysis of the paradigm shift from conventional recommender systems to generative pre-trained-transformers-(GPT)-based chatbots. We highlight recent developments that leverage the power of GPT to create interactive and personalized conversational agents. By exploring natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques, we investigate how GPT models can better understand user preferences and provide context-aware recommendations. The paper further evaluates the advantages and limitations of GPT-based recommender systems, comparing their performance with traditional methods.

ADAHESSIAN directly incorporates approximate curvature information from the loss function, and it includes several novel performance-improving features, including: (i) a fast Hutchinson based method to approximate the curvature matrix with low computational overhead; (ii) a spatial averaging to reduce the variance of the second derivative; and (iii) a root-mean-square exponential moving average to smooth out variations of the second-derivative across different iterations. We perform extensive tests on NLP, CV, and recommendation system tasks, and ADAHESSIAN achieves state-of-the-art results.

In recent years, deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been widely adopted for medical image segmentation and have achieved significant success. UNet, which is based on CNNs, is the mainstream method used for medical image segmentation. However, its performance suffers owing to its inability to capture long-range dependencies. Transformers were initially designed for Natural Language Processing (NLP), and sequence-to-sequence applications have demonstrated the ability to capture long-range dependencies. However, their abilities to acquire local information are limited. Hybrid architectures of CNNs and Transformer, such as TransUNet, have been proposed to benefit from Transformer’s long-range dependencies and CNNs’ low-level details. Nevertheless, automatic medical image segmentation remains a challenging task due to factors such as blurred boundaries, the low-contrast tissue environment, and in the context of ultrasound, issues like speckle noise and attenuation. In this paper, we propose a new model that combines the strengths of both CNNs and Transformer, with network architectural improvements designed to enrich the feature representation captured by the skip connections and the decoder. To this end, we devised a new attention module called Three-Level Attention (TLA). This module is composed of an Attention Gate (AG), channel attention, and spatial normalization mechanism. The AG preserves structural information, whereas channel attention helps to model the interdependencies between channels. Spatial normalization employs the spatial coefficient of the Transformer to improve spatial attention akin to TransNorm. To further improve the skip connection and reduce the semantic gap, skip connections between the encoder and decoder were redesigned in a manner similar to that of the UNet++ dense connection. Moreover, deep supervision using a side-output channel was introduced, analogous to BASNet, which was originally used for saliency predictions. Two datasets from different modalities, a CT scan dataset and an ultrasound dataset, were used to evaluate the proposed UNet architecture.

To investigate if tailoring a transformer-based language model to radiology is beneficial for radiology natural language processing (NLP) applications.


Materials and Methods
This retrospective study presents a family of bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT)-based language models adapted for radiology, named RadBERT. Transformers were pretrained with either 2.16 or 4.42 million radiology reports from U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs health care systems nationwide on top of four different initializations (BERT-base, Clinical-BERT, robustly optimized BERT pretraining approach [RoBERTa], and BioMed-RoBERTa) to create six variants of RadBERT. Each variant was fine-tuned for three representative NLP tasks in radiology: (a) abnormal sentence classification: models classified sentences in radiology reports as reporting abnormal or normal findings; (b) report coding: models assigned a diagnostic code to a given radiology report for five coding systems; and (c) report summarization: given the findings section of a radiology report, models selected key sentences that summarized the findings. Model performance was compared by bootstrap resampling with five intensively studied transformer language models as baselines: BERT-base, BioBERT, Clinical-BERT, BlueBERT, and BioMed-RoBERTa.


Results
For abnormal sentence classification, all models performed well (accuracies above 97.5 and F1 scores above 95.0). RadBERT variants achieved significantly higher scores than corresponding baselines when given only 10% or less of 12 458 annotated training sentences. For report coding, all variants outperformed baselines significantly for all five coding systems. The variant RadBERT-BioMed-RoBERTa performed the best among all models for report summarization, achieving a Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation-1 score of 16.18 compared with 15.27 by the corresponding baseline (BioMed-RoBERTa, P < .004).


Conclusion
Transformer-based language models tailored to radiology had improved performance of radiology NLP tasks compared with baseline transformer language models.Keywords: Translation, Unsupervised Learning, Transfer Learning, Neural Networks, Informatics Supplemental material is available for this article. © RSNA, 2022See also commentary by Wiggins and Tejani in this issue.","RadBERT: Adapting Transformer-based Language Models to Radiology..Purpose

Recently, several works [ASA+22,GTLV22,ONR+22] have studied the in-context learning from a mathematical perspective based on a linear regression formulation $\min_x\| Ax - b \|_2$, which show Transformers' capability of learning linear functions in context. In this work, we study the in-context learning based on a softmax regression formulation $\min_{x} \| \langle \exp(Ax), {\bf 1}_n \rangle^{-1} \exp(Ax) - b \|_2$ of Transformer's attention mechanism. We show the upper bounds of the data transformations induced by a single self-attention layer and by gradient-descent on a $\ell_2$ regression loss for softmax prediction function, which imply that when training self-attention-only Transformers for fundamental regression tasks, the models learned by gradient-descent and Transformers show great similarity.",-7.76192,7.2854595,1

However, ViTs’ self-attention module is still arguably a major bottleneck, limiting their achievable hardware efficiency and more extensive applications to resource constrained platforms. Meanwhile, existing accelerators dedicated to NLP Transformers are not optimal for ViTs. This is because there is a large difference between ViTs and Transformers for natural language processing (NLP) tasks: ViTs have a relatively fixed number of input tokens, whose attention maps can be pruned by up to 90% even with fixed sparse patterns, without severely hurting the model accuracy (e.g., <=1.5% under 90% pruning ratio); while NLP Transformers need to handle input sequences of varying numbers of tokens and rely on on-the-fly predictions of dynamic sparse attention patterns for each input to achieve a decent sparsity (e.g., >=50%). To this end, we propose a dedicated algorithm and accelerator co-design framework dubbed ViTCoD for accelerating ViTs. Specifically, on the algorithm level, ViTCoD prunes and polarizes the attention maps to have either denser or sparser fixed patterns for regularizing two levels of workloads without hurting the accuracy, largely reducing the attention computations while leaving room for alleviating the remaining dominant data movements; on top of that, we further integrate a lightweight and learnable auto-encoder module to enable trading the dominant high-cost data movements for lower-cost computations. On the hardware level, we develop a dedicated accelerator to simultaneously coordinate the aforementioned enforced denser and sparser workloads for boosted hardware utilization, while integrating on-chip encoder and decoder engines to leverage ViTCoD’s algorithm pipeline for much reduced data movements.

In this paper, we present SOLE, a hardware-software co-design for Softmax and LayerNorm which is composed of E2Softmax and AILayerNorm.

However, their real-time inference speed and efficiency are limited due to the inefficiency in Softmax and Layer Normalization (LayerNorm). Previous works based on function approximation suffer from inefficient implementation as they place emphasis on computation while disregarding memory overhead concerns. Moreover, such methods rely on retraining to compensate for approximation error which can be costly and inconvenient. In this paper, we present SOLE, a hardware-software co-design for Softmax and LayerNorm which is composed of E2Softmax and AILayerNorm. E2Softmax utilizes log2 quantization of exponent function and log-based division to approximate Softmax while AILayerNorm adopts low-precision statistic calculation.

The proposed model was then evaluated in BLVD, a more practical dataset without the overfitting issue of NGSIM. Compared to other relevant approaches, our model exhibits state-of-the-art performance for both short and long-term prediction.",-19.541895,8.98556,1

Current state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) techniques use transformer deep learning architectures, which depend on large training datasets. We hypothesized that traditional NLP techniques may outperform transformers for smaller radiology report datasets.


METHODS
We compared the performance of BioBERT, a deep learning-based transformer model pre-trained on biomedical text, and three traditional machine learning models (gradient boosted tree, random forest, and logistic regression) on seven classification tasks given free-text radiology reports. Tasks included detection of appendicitis, diverticulitis, bowel obstruction, and enteritis/colitis on abdomen/pelvis CT reports, ischemic infarct on brain CT/MRI reports, and medial and lateral meniscus tears on knee MRI reports (7,204 total annotated reports). The performance of NLP models on held-out test sets were compared after training using the full training set, and 2.5%, 10%, 25%, 50%, and 75% random subsets of the training data.


RESULTS
In all tested classification tasks, BioBERT performed poorly at smaller training sample sizes compared to non-deep learning NLP models. Specifically, BioBERT required training on approximately 1,000 reports to perform similarly or better than non-deep learning models. At around 1,250 to 1,500 training samples, the testing performance for all models began to plateau, where additional training data yielded minimal performance gain.


CONCLUSIONS
With larger sample sizes, transformer NLP models achieved superior performance in radiology report binary classification tasks. However, with smaller sizes (<1000) and more imbalanced training data, traditional NLP techniques performed better.


ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE
Our benchmarks can help guide clinical NLP researchers in selecting machine learning models according to their dataset characteristics.","Transformer versus traditional natural language processing: How much data is enough for automated radiology report classification?.OBJECTIVES

To train a deep natural language processing (NLP) model, using data mined structured oncology reports (SOR), for rapid tumor response category (TRC) classification from free-text oncology reports (FTOR) and to compare its performance with human readers and conventional NLP algorithms.


Materials and Methods
In this retrospective study, databases of three independent radiology departments were queried for SOR and FTOR dated from March 2018 to August 2021. An automated data mining and curation pipeline was developed to extract Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors-related TRCs for SOR for ground truth definition. The deep NLP bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) model and three feature-rich algorithms were trained on SOR to predict TRCs in FTOR. Models' F1 scores were compared against scores of radiologists, medical students, and radiology technologist students. Lexical and semantic analyses were conducted to investigate human and model performance on FTOR.


Results
Oncologic findings and TRCs were accurately mined from 9653 of 12 833 (75.2%) queried SOR, yielding oncology reports from 10 455 patients (mean age, 60 years ± 14 [SD]; 5303 women) who met inclusion criteria.

In recent years, transfer learning with transformers is one of the most used forms of deep neural networks for natural language processing.

Since the input length of the BERT network is limited and constant and the news body is usually a long text, we cannot feed the whole text into the BERT. Therefore, using the MaxWorth algorithm, we selected the part of the news text that is more valuable for fact-checking, and fed it into the BERT network.

However, simply stacking more layers of the popular Transformer architecture for machine translation results in poor convergence and high computational overhead. Our empirical analysis suggests that convergence is poor due to gradient vanishing caused by the interaction between residual connection and layer normalization. We propose depth-scaled initialization (DS-Init), which decreases parameter variance at the initialization stage, and reduces output variance of residual connections so as to ease gradient back-propagation through normalization layers. To address computational cost, we propose a merged attention sublayer (MAtt) which combines a simplified average-based self-attention sublayer and the encoder-decoder attention sublayer on the decoder side. Results on WMT and IWSLT translation tasks with five translation directions show that deep Transformers with DS-Init and MAtt can substantially outperform their base counterpart in terms of BLEU (+1.1 BLEU on average for 12-layer models), while matching the decoding speed of the baseline model thanks to the efficiency improvements of MAtt.

The authors tested whether natural language processing (NLP) methods can detect and classify cognitive distortions in text messages between clinicians and people with serious mental illness as effectively as clinically trained human raters.


METHODS
Text messages (N=7,354) were collected from 39 clients in a randomized controlled trial of a 12-week texting intervention. Clinical annotators labeled messages for common cognitive distortions: mental filtering, jumping to conclusions, catastrophizing, ""should"" statements, and overgeneralizing. Multiple NLP classification methods were applied to the same messages, and performance was compared.


RESULTS
A tuned model that used bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (F1=0.62) achieved performance comparable to that of clinical raters in classifying texts with any distortion (F1=0.63) and superior to that of other models.


CONCLUSIONS
NLP methods can be used to effectively detect and classify cognitive distortions in text exchanges, and they have the potential to inform scalable automated tools for clinical support during message-based care for people with serious mental illness.","Automated Detection of Cognitive Distortions in Text Exchanges Between Clinicians and People With Serious Mental Illness..OBJECTIVE

The development of deep, bidirectional transformers such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) led to an outperformance of several Natural Language Processing (NLP) benchmarks. Especially in radiology, large amounts of free-text data are generated in the daily clinical workflow. These report texts could be of particular use for the generation of labels in machine learning, especially for image classification. However, as report text are mostly unstructured, advanced NLP methods are needed for text classification. While neural networks can be used for this purpose, they must first be trained on large amounts of manually labelled data in order to achieve good results. In contrast, BERT models can be pre-trained on unlabelledunlabeled data and then only require fine tuning on a small amount of manually labelled data to achieve even better results.


RESULTS
By using BERT to identify the most important findings in intensive care chest x-ray reports, we achieve areas under the receiver operation characteristics curve of 0.98 for congestion, 0.97 for effusion, 0.97 for consolidation and 0.99 for pneumothorax, surpassing the accuracy of previous approaches with comparatively little annotation effort. Our approach could help to improve information extraction from free-text medical reports.

Additionally, due to independent sub-space projections in the self-attention layer, the model is highly parallelizable which makes it a good candidate for on-device SLU.",-15.153467,28.482319,1

A biomedical relation statement is commonly expressed in multiple sentences and consists of many concepts, including gene, disease, chemical, and mutation. To automatically extract information from biomedical literature, existing biomedical text-mining approaches typically formulate the problem as a cross-sentence n-ary relation-extraction task that detects relations among n entities across multiple sentences, and use either a graph neural network (GNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) or an attention mechanism. Recently, Transformer has been shown to outperform LSTM on many natural language processing (NLP) tasks.


RESULTS
In this work, we propose a novel architecture that combines Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers with Graph Transformer (BERT-GT), through integrating a neighbor-attention mechanism into the BERT architecture. Unlike the original Transformer architecture, which utilizes the whole sentence(s) to calculate the attention of the current token, the neighbor-attention mechanism in our method calculates its attention utilizing only its neighbor tokens. Thus, each token can pay attention to its neighbor information with little noise. We show that this is critically important when the text is very long, as in cross-sentence or abstract-level relation-extraction tasks. Our benchmarking results show improvements of 5.44% and 3.89% in accuracy and F1-measure over the state-of-the-art on n-ary and chemical-protein relation datasets, suggesting BERT-GT is a robust approach that is applicable to other biomedical relation extraction tasks or datasets.

To overcome this issue, several neural few-shot classification models have emerged, yielding significant progress over time, both in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. In the latter, such models used to rely on fixed word embeddings, before the advent of transformers. Additionally, some models used in Computer Vision are yet to be tested in NLP applications. In this paper, we compare all these models, first adapting those made in the field of image processing to NLP, and second providing them access to transformers.

To overcome this issue, several neural few-shot classification models have emerged, yielding significant progress over time, both in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. In the latter, such models used to rely on fixed word embeddings, before the advent of transformers. Additionally, some models used in Computer Vision are yet to be tested in NLP applications. In this paper, we compare all these models, first adapting those made in the field of image processing to NLP, and second providing them access to transformers.

 Background: Pre-training large-scale neural language models on raw texts has been shown to make a significant contribution to a strategy for transfer learning in natural language processing (NLP). With the introduction of transformer-based language models, such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), the performance of information extraction from free text by NLP has significantly improved for both the general domain and the medical domain; however, it is difficult for languages in which there are few publicly available medical databases with a high quality and a large size to train medical BERT models that perform well.Method: We introduce a method to train a BERT model using a small medical corpus both in English and in Japanese. Our proposed method consists of two interventions: simultaneous pre-training, which is intended to encourage masked language modeling and next-sentence prediction on the small medical corpus, and amplified vocabulary, which helps with suiting the small corpus when building the customized corpus by byte-pair encoding. Moreover, we used whole PubMed abstracts and developed a high-performance BERT model, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for Biomedical Text Mining by Osaka University (ouBioBERT), in English via our method. We then evaluated the performance of our BERT models and publicly available baselines and compared them.Results: We confirmed that our Japanese medical BERT outperforms conventional baselines and the other BERT models in terms of the medical-document classification task and that our English BERT pre-trained using both the general and medical domain corpora performs sufficiently for practical use in terms of the biomedical language understanding evaluation (BLUE) benchmark. Moreover, ouBioBERT shows that the total score of the BLUE benchmark is 1.1 points above that of BioBERT and 0.3 points above that of the ablation model trained without our proposed method.Conclusions: Our proposed method makes it feasible to construct a practical medical BERT model in both Japanese and English, and it has a potential to produce higher performing models for biomedical shared tasks.","A Pre-Training Technique to Localize Medical BERT and to Enhance Biomedical BERT.

However, FH information is not well captured in the structured database but often documented in clinical narratives. Natural language processing (NLP) is the key technology to extract patients’ FH from clinical narratives. In 2019, the National NLP Clinical Challenge (n2c2) organized shared tasks to solicit NLP methods for FH information extraction. Objective This study presents our end-to-end FH extraction system developed during the 2019 n2c2 open shared task as well as the new transformer-based models that we developed after the challenge. We seek to develop a machine learning–based solution for FH information extraction without task-specific rules created by hand. Methods We developed deep learning–based systems for FH concept extraction and relation identification. We explored deep learning models including long short-term memory-conditional random fields and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) as well as developed ensemble models using a majority voting strategy. To further optimize performance, we systematically compared 3 different strategies to use BERT output representations for relation identification. Results Our system was among the top-ranked systems (3 out of 21) in the challenge. Our best system achieved micro-averaged F1 scores of 0.7944 and 0.6544 for concept extraction and relation identification, respectively. After challenge, we further explored new transformer-based models and improved the performances of both subtasks to 0.8249 and 0.6775, respectively. For relation identification, our system achieved a performance comparable to the best system (0.6810) reported in the challenge.

Deep learning-based approaches have been successfully applied to the task, but they often rely on traditional pre-trained context-independent word embedding. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) is recently employed to pre-train contextualized word/sentence representation models via bidirectional Transformers, outperforming the state-of-the-art for many NLP tasks. The mutual semantic influence between sentences is important for estimating semantic textual similarity, which is neglected in existing methods including BERT. On the other hand, biomedical corpora mainly consist of syntactic complex and long sentences. Owing to the above-mentioned issues, we proposed a hybrid architecture, integrating the pre-trained BERT and downstream bidirectional recurrent neural network (bi-RNN). The proposed model enhanced the sentence semantic representation via employing the self-attention instead of global attention to perform cross attention between sentences. Meanwhile, bi-RNN reduced redundant information in the output of BERT. Experimental results show that the best fine-tuned models consistently outperform previous methods and advance the state-of-the-art for clinical semantic textual similarity in OHNLP 2018 task 2, with up to 0.6% increase in Pearson correlation coefficient.","Cross2Self-attentive Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network with BERT for Biomedical Semantic Text Similarity.Estimating the similarity of biomedical sentence pair is an important component in such natural language processing (NLP) tasks as text retrieval and text summarization with great amount of biomedical information growing.

Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) is recently employed to pre-train contextualized word/sentence representation models via bidirectional Transformers, outperforming the state-of-the-art for many NLP tasks. The mutual semantic influence between sentences is important for estimating semantic textual similarity, which is neglected in existing methods including BERT. On the other hand, biomedical corpora mainly consist of syntactic complex and long sentences. Owing to the above-mentioned issues, we proposed a hybrid architecture, integrating the pre-trained BERT and downstream bidirectional recurrent neural network (bi-RNN). The proposed model enhanced the sentence semantic representation via employing the self-attention instead of global attention to perform cross attention between sentences. Meanwhile, bi-RNN reduced redundant information in the output of BERT. Experimental results show that the best fine-tuned models consistently outperform previous methods and advance the state-of-the-art for clinical semantic textual similarity in OHNLP 2018 task 2, with up to 0.6% increase in Pearson correlation coefficient.",-19.446924,-12.550309,0

Many have come to believe that because of this, transformers are not suitable for small sets of data. This trend leads to concerns such as: limited availability of data in certain scientific domains and the exclusion of those with limited resource from research in the field. In this paper, we aim to present an approach for small-scale learning by introducing Compact Transformers. We show for the first time that with the right size, convolutional tokenization, transformers can avoid overfitting and outperform state-of-the-art CNNs on small datasets. Our models are flexible in terms of model size, and can have as little as 0.28M parameters while achieving competitive results. Our best model can reach 98% accuracy when training from scratch on CIFAR-10 with only 3.7M parameters, which is a significant improvement in data-efficiency over previous Transformer based models being over 10x smaller than other transformers and is 15% the size of ResNet50 while achieving similar performance. CCT also outperforms many modern CNN based approaches, and even some recent NAS-based approaches.

Many have come to believe that because of this, transformers are not suitable for small sets of data. This trend leads to concerns such as: limited availability of data in certain scientific domains and the exclusion of those with limited resource from research in the field. In this paper, we aim to present an approach for small-scale learning by introducing Compact Transformers. We show for the first time that with the right size, convolutional tokenization, transformers can avoid overfitting and outperform state-of-the-art CNNs on small datasets. Our models are flexible in terms of model size, and can have as little as 0.28M parameters while achieving competitive results. Our best model can reach 98% accuracy when training from scratch on CIFAR-10 with only 3.7M parameters, which is a significant improvement in data-efficiency over previous Transformer based models being over 10x smaller than other transformers and is 15% the size of ResNet50 while achieving similar performance. CCT also outperforms many modern CNN based approaches, and even some recent NAS-based approaches. Additionally, we obtain a new SOTA result on Flowers-102 with 99.76% top-1 accuracy, and improve upon the existing baseline on ImageNet (82.71% accuracy with 29% as many parameters as ViT), as well as NLP tasks.

Tasks such as Named Entity Recognition (NER) and syntactic parsing require highly domain-matched training data for good performance. To date, there is no complete training corpus for both NER and syntactic analysis (e.g., part of speech tagging, dependency parsing) of tweets. While there are some publicly available annotated NLP datasets of tweets, they are only designed for individual tasks. In this study, we aim to create Tweebank-NER, an English NER corpus based on Tweebank V2 (TB2), train state-of-the-art (SOTA) Tweet NLP models on TB2, and release an NLP pipeline called Twitter-Stanza. We annotate named entities in TB2 using Amazon Mechanical Turk and measure the quality of our annotations. We train the Stanza pipeline on TB2 and compare with alternative NLP frameworks (e.g., FLAIR, spaCy) and transformer-based models. The Stanza tokenizer and lemmatizer achieve SOTA performance on TB2, while the Stanza NER tagger, part-of-speech (POS) tagger, and dependency parser achieve competitive performance against non-transformer models.

Tasks such as Named Entity Recognition (NER) and syntactic parsing require highly domain-matched training data for good performance. To date, there is no complete training corpus for both NER and syntactic analysis (e.g., part of speech tagging, dependency parsing) of tweets. While there are some publicly available annotated NLP datasets of tweets, they are only designed for individual tasks. In this study, we aim to create Tweebank-NER, an English NER corpus based on Tweebank V2 (TB2), train state-of-the-art (SOTA) Tweet NLP models on TB2, and release an NLP pipeline called Twitter-Stanza. We annotate named entities in TB2 using Amazon Mechanical Turk and measure the quality of our annotations. We train the Stanza pipeline on TB2 and compare with alternative NLP frameworks (e.g., FLAIR, spaCy) and transformer-based models. The Stanza tokenizer and lemmatizer achieve SOTA performance on TB2, while the Stanza NER tagger, part-of-speech (POS) tagger, and dependency parser achieve competitive performance against non-transformer models. The transformer-based models establish a strong baseline in Tweebank-NER and achieve the new SOTA performance in POS tagging and dependency parsing on TB2.

Yet, the unprecedented size of an NLP model stresses both latency and memory, creating a tension between the two key resources of a mobile device. To meet a target latency, holding the whole model in memory launches execution as soon as possible but increases one app’s memory footprints by several times, limiting its benefits to only a few inferences before being recycled by mobile memory management. On the other hand, loading the model from storage on demand incurs IO as long as a few seconds, far exceeding the delay range satisfying to a user; pipelining layerwise model loading and execution does not hide IO either, due to the high skewness between IO and computation delays. To this end, we propose Speedy Transformer Inference (STI). Built on the key idea of maximizing IO/compute resource utilization on the most important parts of a model, STI reconciles the latency v.s. memory tension via two novel techniques. First, model sharding. STI manages model parameters as independently tunable shards, and profiles their importance to accuracy. Second, elastic pipeline planning with a preload buffer. STI instantiates an IO/compute pipeline and uses a small buffer for preload shards to bootstrap execution without stalling at early stages; it judiciously selects, tunes, and assembles shards per their importance for resource-elastic execution, maximizing inference accuracy. Atop two commodity SoCs, we build STI and evaluate it against a wide range of NLP tasks, under a practical range of target latencies, and on both CPU and GPU. We demonstrate that STI delivers high accuracies with 1–2 orders of magnitude lower memory, outperforming competitive baselines.","STI: Turbocharge NLP Inference at the Edge via Elastic Pipelining.Natural Language Processing (NLP) inference is seeing increasing adoption by mobile applications, where on-device inference is desirable for crucially preserving user data privacy and avoiding network roundtrips.

Here, we demonstrate how transformer models can be used to predict, directly from the primary amino acid sequence, the thermal stability of collagen triple helices, measured via the melting temperature Tm. We report two distinct transformer architectures to compare performance. First, we train a small transformer model from scratch, using our collagen data set featuring only 633 sequence-to-Tm pairings. Second, we use a large pretrained transformer model, ProtBERT, and fine-tune it for a particular downstream task by utilizing sequence-to-Tm pairings, using a deep convolutional network to translate natural language processing BERT embeddings into required features. Both the small transformer model and the fine-tuned ProtBERT model have similar R2 values of test data (R2 = 0.84 vs 0.79, respectively), but the ProtBERT is a much larger pretrained model that may not always be applicable for other biological or biomaterials questions. Specifically, we show that the small transformer model requires only 0.026% of the number of parameters compared to the much larger model but reaches almost the same accuracy for the test set. We compare the performance of both models against 71 newly published sequences for which Tm has been obtained as a validation set and find reasonable agreement, with ProtBERT outperforming the small transformer model. The results presented here are, to our best knowledge, the first demonstration of the use of transformer models for relatively small data sets and for the prediction of specific biophysical properties of interest.

Nevertheless, they still make mistakes from time to time. For a model deployed in an industrial environment, fixing these mistakes quickly and robustly is vital to improve user experiences. Previous works formalize such problems as Model Editing (ME) and mostly focus on fixing one mistake. However, the one-mistake-fixing scenario is not an accurate abstraction of the real-world challenge. In the deployment of AI services, there are ever-emerging mistakes, and the same mistake may recur if not corrected in time. Thus a preferable solution is to rectify the mistakes as soon as they appear nonstop. Therefore, we extend the existing ME into Sequential Model Editing (SME) to help develop more practical editing methods. Our study shows that most current ME methods could yield unsatisfying results in this scenario. We then introduce Transformer-Patcher, a novel model editor that can shift the behavior of transformer-based models by simply adding and training a few neurons in the last Feed-Forward Network layer. Experimental results on both classification and generation tasks show that Transformer-Patcher can successively correct up to thousands of errors (Reliability) and generalize to their equivalent inputs (Generality) while retaining the model's accuracy on irrelevant inputs (Locality). Our method outperforms previous fine-tuning and HyperNetwork-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance for Sequential Model Editing (SME).

ChatGPT has been praised for its ability to generate text, but concerns have been raised about its accuracy and precision in generating data, as well as legal issues related to references. This study aims to investigate the frequency of AI hallucination in research proposals entirely drafted by ChatGPT. Methodology An analytical design was employed to investigate AI hallucination by ChatGPT. A total of 178 references listed by ChatGPT were verified for inclusion in the study. Statistical analysis was performed by five researchers who entered their data into a Google Form, and the final results were represented using pie charts and tables. Results Out of the 178 references analyzed, 69 references did not have a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), and 28 references neither turned up on Google search nor had an existing DOI. Three references were listed from books and not research articles. These observations suggest that ChatGPT’s ability to generate reliable references for research topics may be limited by the availability of DOI and the accessibility of online articles. Conclusions The study highlights the potential limitations of ChatGPT’s ability to generate reliable references for research proposals. AI hallucination is a problem that may negatively impact decision-making and may give rise to ethical and legal problems. Improving the training inputs by including diverse, accurate, and contextually relevant data sets along with frequent updates to the training models could potentially help address these issues.

Specifically, we propose Multi-Task Diffusion Model (\textsc{MTDiff}), a diffusion-based method that incorporates Transformer backbones and prompt learning for generative planning and data synthesis in multi-task offline settings. \textsc{MTDiff} leverages vast amounts of knowledge available in multi-task data and performs implicit knowledge sharing among tasks. For generative planning, we find \textsc{MTDiff} outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms across 50 tasks on Meta-World and 8 maps on Maze2D.

Natural language processing (NLP), a branch of artificial intelligence, offers the potential for improving depression screening by extracting meaningful information from textual data, but there are challenges and ethical considerations. Objective This literature review aims to explore existing NLP methods for detecting depression, discuss successes and limitations, address ethical concerns, and highlight potential biases. Methods A literature search was conducted using Semantic Scholar, PubMed, and Google Scholar to identify studies on depression screening using NLP. Keywords included “depression screening,” “depression detection,” and “natural language processing.” Studies were included if they discussed the application of NLP techniques for depression screening or detection. Studies were screened and selected for relevance, with data extracted and synthesized to identify common themes and gaps in the literature. Results NLP techniques, including sentiment analysis, linguistic markers, and deep learning models, offer practical tools for depression screening. Supervised and unsupervised machine learning models and large language models like transformers have demonstrated high accuracy in a variety of application domains. However, ethical concerns related to privacy, bias, interpretability, and lack of regulations to protect individuals arise. Furthermore, cultural and multilingual perspectives highlight the need for culturally sensitive models. Conclusions NLP presents opportunities to enhance depression detection, but considerable challenges persist. Ethical concerns must be addressed, governance guidance is needed to mitigate risks, and cross-cultural perspectives must be integrated.

Natural language processing (NLP), a branch of artificial intelligence, offers the potential for improving depression screening by extracting meaningful information from textual data, but there are challenges and ethical considerations. Objective This literature review aims to explore existing NLP methods for detecting depression, discuss successes and limitations, address ethical concerns, and highlight potential biases. Methods A literature search was conducted using Semantic Scholar, PubMed, and Google Scholar to identify studies on depression screening using NLP. Keywords included “depression screening,” “depression detection,” and “natural language processing.” Studies were included if they discussed the application of NLP techniques for depression screening or detection. Studies were screened and selected for relevance, with data extracted and synthesized to identify common themes and gaps in the literature. Results NLP techniques, including sentiment analysis, linguistic markers, and deep learning models, offer practical tools for depression screening. Supervised and unsupervised machine learning models and large language models like transformers have demonstrated high accuracy in a variety of application domains. However, ethical concerns related to privacy, bias, interpretability, and lack of regulations to protect individuals arise. Furthermore, cultural and multilingual perspectives highlight the need for culturally sensitive models. Conclusions NLP presents opportunities to enhance depression detection, but considerable challenges persist. Ethical concerns must be addressed, governance guidance is needed to mitigate risks, and cross-cultural perspectives must be integrated. Future directions include improving interpretability, personalization, and increased collaboration with domain experts, such as data scientists and machine learning engineers. NLP’s potential to enhance mental health care remains promising, depending on overcoming obstacles and continuing innovation.",-30.002655,-24.318575,0

Identifying and detecting the risk factors for heart disease such as diabetes mellitus, Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), hyperlipidemia, hypertension, smoking, familial CAD history, obesity, and medications is critical for developing effective preventative and management measures. Although Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have emerged as valuable resources for identifying these risk factors, their unstructured format poses challenges for cardiologists in retrieving relevant information. This research proposed employing transfer learning techniques to automatically extract heart disease risk factors from EHRs. Leveraging transfer learning, a deep learning technique has demonstrated a significant performance in various clinical natural language processing (NLP) applications, particularly in heart disease risk prediction. This study explored the application of transformer-based language models, specifically utilizing pre-trained architectures like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), RoBERTa, BioClinicalBERT, XLNet, and BioBERT for heart disease detection and extraction of related risk factors from clinical notes, using the i2b2 dataset. These transformer models are pre-trained on an extensive corpus of medical literature and clinical records to gain a deep understanding of contextualized language representations. Adapted models are then fine-tuned using annotated datasets specific to heart disease, such as the i2b2 dataset, enabling them to learn patterns and relationships within the domain. These models have demonstrated superior performance in extracting semantic information from EHRs, automating high-performance heart disease risk factor identification, and performing downstream NLP tasks within the clinical domain. This study proposed fine-tuned five widely used transformer-based models, namely BERT, RoBERTa, BioClinicalBERT, XLNet, and BioBERT, using the 2014 i2b2 clinical NLP challenge dataset. The fine-tuned models surpass conventional approaches in predicting the presence of heart disease risk factors with impressive accuracy. The RoBERTa model has achieved the highest performance, with micro F1-scores of 94.27%, while the BERT, BioClinicalBERT, XLNet, and BioBERT models have provided competitive performances with micro F1-scores of 93.73%, 94.03%, 93.97%, and 93.99%, respectively. Finally, a simple ensemble of the five transformer-based models has been proposed, which outperformed the most existing methods in heart disease risk fan, achieving a micro F1-Score of 94.26%. This study demonstrated the efficacy of transfer learning using transformer-based models in enhancing risk prediction and facilitating early intervention for heart disease prevention.","Adapting transformer-based language models for heart disease detection and risk factors extraction.Efficiently treating cardiac patients before the onset of a heart attack relies on the precise prediction of heart disease.

To investigate alignment tax, we conducted experiments with existing RLHF algorithms using OpenLLaMA-3B, which revealed a pronounced alignment tax in NLP tasks. Whereas, despite various techniques to mitigate forgetting, they are often at odds with the RLHF performance, leading to a trade-off between alignment performance and forgetting mitigation, leading to an alignment-forgetting trade-off. In this paper we show that model averaging, which simply interpolates between pre and post RLHF model weights, surprisingly achieves the most strongest alignment-forgetting Pareto front among a wide range of competing methods. To understand its effectiveness, we offer theoretical insights into model averaging, revealing that it enhances performance Pareto front by increasing feature diversity on the layers where tasks share overlapped feature spaces. Empirical evidence corroborates our analysis by showing the benefits of averaging low-level transformer layers. Building on the analysis and the observation that averaging different layers of the transformer leads to significantly different alignment-forgetting trade-offs, we propose Heterogeneous Model Averaging (HMA) to Heterogeneously find various combination ratios of model layers. HMA seeks to maximize the alignment performance while incurring minimal alignment tax.

Furthermore, the model can automate repetitive tasks and improve process efficiency while enabling knowledge workers to communicate analysis findings, support evidence, and make decisions. ProcessGPT can revolutionize business process management (BPM) by offering a powerful tool for process automation and improvement. Finally, we demonstrate how ProcessGPT can be a powerful tool for augmenting data engineers in maintaining data ecosystem processes within large bank organizations. Our scenario highlights the potential of this approach to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance the quality of business operations through the automation of data-centric and knowledge-intensive processes. These results underscore the promise of ProcessGPT as a transformative technology for organizations looking to improve their process workflows.",0.50027263,30.878098,0

However, the accuracy of sentiment analysis is disrupted by the challenges of natural language processing (NLP). Recently, deep learning models have proved superior performance over statistical- and lexical-based approaches in NLP-related tasks. Word embedding is an important layer of deep learning models to generate input features. Many word embedding models have been presented for text representation of both classic and context-based word embeddings. In this paper, we present a comparative analysis to evaluate both classic and contextualized word embeddings for sentiment analysis. The four most frequently used word embedding techniques were used in their trained and pre-trained versions. The selected embedding represents classical and contextualized techniques. Classical word embedding includes algorithms such as GloVe, Word2vec, and FastText. By contrast, ARBERT is used as a contextualized embedding model. Since word embedding is more typically employed as the input layer in deep networks, we used deep learning architectures BiLSTM and CNN for sentiment classification. To achieve these goals, the experiments were applied to a series of benchmark datasets: HARD, Khooli, AJGT, ArSAS, and ASTD. Finally, a comparative analysis was conducted on the results obtained for the experimented models. Our outcomes indicate that, generally, generated embedding by one technique achieves higher performance than its pretrained version for the same technique by around 0.28 to 1.8% accuracy, 0.33 to 2.17% precision, and 0.44 to 2% recall. Moreover, the contextualized transformer-based embedding model BERT achieved the highest performance in its pretrained and trained versions.

Despite its superiority, the global–level self-attention consumes <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\sim 100\times $ </tex-math></inline-formula> more operations than CNNs and cannot be effectively handled by the existing CNN processor due to the distinct operations.

This article proposes a Transformer processor effectively handling the WR-Tokens to solve these challenges.

Second, a bidirectional asymptotical speculation unit captures and removes redundant computations of zero attention outputs by exploiting the local property of self-attention.

However, reasoning with formal language has proved challenging (e.g., brittleness and knowledge-acquisition bottleneck). This paper provides a comprehensive overview on a new paradigm of logical reasoning, which uses natural language as knowledge representation and pretrained language models as reasoners, including philosophical definition and categorization of logical reasoning, advantages of the new paradigm, benchmarks and methods, challenges of the new paradigm, possible future directions, and relation to related NLP fields. This new paradigm is promising since it not only alleviates many challenges of formal representation but also has advantages over end-to-end neural methods. This survey focus on transformer-based LLMs explicitly working on deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning over English representation.",-3.137527,29.153933,0

With the trends of large NLP models, the increasing memory and computation costs hinder their efficient deployment on resource-limited devices. Therefore, transformer quantization attracts wide research interest. Recent work recognizes that structured outliers are the critical bottleneck for quantization performance. However, their proposed methods increase the computation overhead and still leave the outliers there. To fundamentally address this problem, this paper delves into the inherent inducement and importance of the outliers. We discover that $\boldsymbol \gamma$ in LayerNorm (LN) acts as a sinful amplifier for the outliers, and the importance of outliers varies greatly where some outliers provided by a few tokens cover a large area but can be clipped sharply without negative impacts. Motivated by these findings, we propose an outlier suppression framework including two components: Gamma Migration and Token-Wise Clipping. The Gamma Migration migrates the outlier amplifier to subsequent modules in an equivalent transformation, contributing to a more quantization-friendly model without any extra burden. The Token-Wise Clipping takes advantage of the large variance of token range and designs a token-wise coarse-to-fine pipeline, obtaining a clipping range with minimal final quantization loss in an efficient way. This framework effectively suppresses the outliers and can be used in a plug-and-play mode. Extensive experiments prove that our framework surpasses the existing works and, for the first time, pushes the 6-bit post-training BERT quantization to the full-precision (FP) level.

The ability to design novel proteins tailored for specific purposes would potentially transform our ability to respond to these issues in a timely manner. Recent advances in the field of artificial intelligence are now setting the stage to make this goal achievable. Protein sequences are inherently similar to natural languages: amino acids arrange in a multitude of combinations to form structures that carry function, the same way as letters form words and sentences carry meaning. Accordingly, it is not surprising that, throughout the history of natural language processing (NLP), many of its techniques have been applied to protein research problems. In the past few years we have witnessed revolutionary breakthroughs in the field of NLP. The implementation of transformer pre-trained models has enabled text generation with human-like capabilities, including texts with specific properties such as style or subject. Motivated by its considerable success in NLP tasks, we expect dedicated transformers to dominate custom protein sequence generation in the near future. Fine-tuning pre-trained models on protein families will enable the extension of their repertoires with novel sequences that could be highly divergent but still potentially functional. The combination of control tags such as cellular compartment or function will further enable the controllable design of novel protein functions. Moreover, recent model interpretability methods will allow us to open the ‘black box’ and thus enhance our understanding of folding principles. Early initiatives show the enormous potential of generative language models to design functional sequences. We believe that using generative text models to create novel proteins is a promising and largely unexplored field, and we discuss its foreseeable impact on protein design. Both proteins and natural language are essentially based on a sequential code, but feature complex interactions at multiple scales, which can be useful when transferring machine learning models from one domain to another.

Detecting sarcasm and classifying sentiment and dialect in NLP has practical applications, including spam detection, topic classification, and sentiment analysis. However, sarcasm and sentimental expressions, such as irony, humor, or criticism, can be difficult to identify through traditional NLP methods due to their implicit nature. To address this, we propose a Modified Switch Transformer (MST) for detecting sarcasm and classifying sentiment and dialect in Arabic text data. Our approach includes two key contributions: Variational Enmesh Expert’s Routing ( $VE_{e}R$ ) and Probabilistic Projections ( $P_{\phi} $ ). The switch transformer model incorporates probabilistic projections using a Variational Spatial Gated Unit-MLP to enhance the embedding generation mechanism.

Detecting sarcasm and classifying sentiment and dialect in NLP has practical applications, including spam detection, topic classification, and sentiment analysis. However, sarcasm and sentimental expressions, such as irony, humor, or criticism, can be difficult to identify through traditional NLP methods due to their implicit nature. To address this, we propose a Modified Switch Transformer (MST) for detecting sarcasm and classifying sentiment and dialect in Arabic text data. Our approach includes two key contributions: Variational Enmesh Expert’s Routing ( $VE_{e}R$ ) and Probabilistic Projections ( $P_{\phi} $ ). The switch transformer model incorporates probabilistic projections using a Variational Spatial Gated Unit-MLP to enhance the embedding generation mechanism.

To achieve this goal, we propose a hierarchical transformer architecture that consists of a high-level transformer (HLT) and a low-level transformer (LLT). We break down a long MI trial into a number of short-term intervals. The LLT extracts a feature from each short-term interval, and the HLT pays more attention to the features from more relevant short-term intervals by using the self-attention mechanism of the transformer.

Within a long MI trial spanning a few seconds, the classification algorithm should give more attention to the time periods during which the intended motor task is imagined by the subject without any artifact. To achieve this goal, we propose a hierarchical transformer architecture that consists of a high-level transformer (HLT) and a low-level transformer (LLT). We break down a long MI trial into a number of short-term intervals. The LLT extracts a feature from each short-term interval, and the HLT pays more attention to the features from more relevant short-term intervals by using the self-attention mechanism of the transformer. We have done extensive tests of the proposed scheme on four open MI datasets, and shown that the proposed hierarchical transformer excels in both the subject-dependent and subject-independent tests.",-27.212893,1.3558195,1

Load forecasting is essential for combating these issues as it balances demand and production and contributes to energy management. Current state-of-the-art solutions such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and sequence-to-sequence algorithms (Seq2Seq) are highly accurate, but most studies examine them on a single data stream. On the other hand, in natural language processing (NLP), transformer architecture has become the dominant technique, outperforming RNN and Seq2Seq algorithms while also allowing parallelization. Consequently, this paper proposes a transformer-based architecture for load forecasting by modifying the NLP transformer workflow, adding N-space transformation, and designing a novel technique for handling contextual features. Moreover, in contrast to most load forecasting studies, we evaluate the proposed solution on different data streams under various forecasting horizons and input window lengths in order to ensure result reproducibility. Results show that the proposed approach successfully handles time series with contextual data and outperforms the state-of-the-art Seq2Seq models.","Transformer-Based Model for Electrical Load Forecasting.Amongst energy-related CO2 emissions, electricity is the largest single contributor, and with the proliferation of electric vehicles and other developments, energy use is expected to increase. Load forecasting is essential for combating these issues as it balances demand and production and contributes to energy management.

This means that knowledge acquired to solve a specific task (e.g., language translation) can be useful to boost performance on another task (e.g., sentiment classification). While the benefits of transfer learning have been widely studied in NLP, limited empirical evidence is available when it comes to code-related tasks. In this paper, we assess the performance of the Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) model in supporting four different code-related tasks: (i) automatic bug-fixing, (ii) injection of code mutants, (iii) generation of assert statements, and (iv) code summarization. We pay particular attention in studying the role played by pre-training and multi-task fine-tuning on the model's performance. We show that (i) the T5 can achieve better performance as compared to state-of-the-art baselines; and (ii) while pre-training helps the model, not all tasks benefit from a multi-task fine-tuning.","Using Transfer Learning for Code-Related Tasks.Deep learning (DL) techniques have been used to support several code-related tasks such as code summarization and bug-fixing. In particular, pre-trained transformer models are on the rise, also thanks to the excellent results they achieved in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. The basic idea behind these models is to first pre-train them on a generic dataset using a self-supervised task (e.g., filling masked words in sentences). Then, these models are fine-tuned to support specific tasks of interest (e.g., language translation).

Our GatorTron model, a transformer-based large language model trained using over 90 billion words of text, achieved the best strict and lenient F1-score of 0.8851 and 0.9495 for the extraction of a total number of 16 thyroid nodule characteristics, and 0.9321 for linking characteristics to nodules, outperforming other clinical transformer models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically categorize and apply transformer-based NLP models to extract a large number of clinical relevant thyroid nodule characteristics from ultrasound reports. This study lays ground for assessing the documentation quality of thyroid ultrasound reports and examining outcomes of patients with thyroid nodules using electronic health records.",-34.772057,-13.190061,0

The versatility of natural language makes it difficult to define rule-based methods for determining semantic similarity measures. To address this issue, various semantic similarity methods have been proposed over the years. This survey article traces the evolution of such methods beginning from traditional NLP techniques such as kernel-based methods to the most recent research work on transformer-based models, categorizing them based on their underlying principles as knowledge-based, corpus-based, deep neural network–based methods, and hybrid methods.

Different settings of Transformer architectures have been investigated on publicly available image quality databases. We have found that the proposed TRIQ architecture achieves outstanding performance. The implementation of TRIQ is published on Github (https://github.com/junyongyou/triq).",-31.190186,7.313389,1

Furthermore, we build a large corpus of the Indonesian language that can be utilized for evaluating the next Indonesian GEC task. We evaluate the models in this dataset, and the results show that the Transformer-based automatic error correction model achieved significant and satisfactory results compared with the results of previous research models.",17.68578,14.617433,0

The dataset is available at https://github.com/declare-lab/RECCON. Recognizing the cause behind emotions in text is a fundamental yet under-explored area of research in NLP. Advances in this area hold the potential to improve interpretability and performance in affect-based models. Identifying emotion causes at the utterance level in conversations is particularly challenging due to the intermingling dynamics among the interlocutors.

We wonder if transformer can be used in face recognition and whether it is better than CNNs. Therefore, we investigate the performance of Transformer models in face recognition. Considering the original Transformer may neglect the inter-patch information, we modify the patch generation process and make the tokens with sliding patches which overlaps with each others. The models are trained on CASIA-WebFace and MS-Celeb-1M databases, and evaluated on several mainstream benchmarks, including LFW, SLLFW, CALFW, CPLFW, TALFW, CFP-FP, AGEDB and IJB-C databases.

In this paper, we develop the first advanced Arabic language generation model, AraGPT2, trained from scratch on a large Arabic corpus of internet text and news articles. Our largest model, AraGPT2-mega, has 1.46 billion parameters, which makes it the largest Arabic language model available. The mega model was evaluated and showed success on different tasks including synthetic news generation, and zero-shot question answering. For text generation, our best model achieves a perplexity of 29.8 on held-out Wikipedia articles. A study conducted with human evaluators showed the significant success of AraGPT2-mega in generating news articles that are difficult to distinguish from articles written by humans. We thus develop and release an automatic discriminator model with a 98% percent accuracy in detecting model-generated text. The models are also publicly available, hoping to encourage new research directions and applications for Arabic NLP.","AraGPT2: Pre-Trained Transformer for Arabic Language Generation.Recently, pre-trained transformer-based architectures have proven to be very efficient at language modeling and understanding, given that they are trained on a large enough corpus.

It has been done well by the self-attention mechanism in the current state-of-the-art Transformer encoder, which has brought about significant improvements in the performance of many NLP tasks. Though the Transformer encoder may effectively capture general information in its resulting representations, the backbone information, meaning the gist of the input text, is not specifically focused on. In this paper, we propose explicit and implicit text compression approaches to enhance the Transformer encoding and evaluate models using this approach on several typical downstream tasks that rely on the encoding heavily. Our explicit text compression approaches use dedicated models to compress text, while our implicit text compression approach simply adds an additional module to the main model to handle text compression.

It has been done well by the self-attention mechanism in the current state-of-the-art Transformer encoder, which has brought about significant improvements in the performance of many NLP tasks. Though the Transformer encoder may effectively capture general information in its resulting representations, the backbone information, meaning the gist of the input text, is not specifically focused on. In this paper, we propose explicit and implicit text compression approaches to enhance the Transformer encoding and evaluate models using this approach on several typical downstream tasks that rely on the encoding heavily. Our explicit text compression approaches use dedicated models to compress text, while our implicit text compression approach simply adds an additional module to the main model to handle text compression.

Particularly, deep learning model for diagnosing and prognosing machinery health has leveraged predictive maintenance (PdM) to be more accurate and reliable in decision making, in this way avoiding unnecessary interventions, machinery accidents, and environment catastrophes. Recently, Transformer Neural Networks have gained notoriety and have been increasingly the favorite choice for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Thus, given their recent major achievements in NLP, this paper proposes the development of an automatic fault classifier model for predictive maintenance based on a modified version of the Transformer architecture, namely T4PdM, to identify multiple types of faults in rotating machinery. Experimental results are developed and presented for the MaFaulDa and CWRU databases. T4PdM was able to achieve an overall accuracy of 99.98% and 98% for both datasets, respectively. In addition, the performance of the proposed model is compared to other previously published works. It has demonstrated the superiority of the model in detecting and classifying faults in rotating industrial machinery. Therefore, the proposed Transformer-based model can improve the performance of machinery fault analysis and diagnostic processes and leverage companies to a new era of the Industry 4.0.

Recently, Transformer Neural Networks have gained notoriety and have been increasingly the favorite choice for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Thus, given their recent major achievements in NLP, this paper proposes the development of an automatic fault classifier model for predictive maintenance based on a modified version of the Transformer architecture, namely T4PdM, to identify multiple types of faults in rotating machinery. Experimental results are developed and presented for the MaFaulDa and CWRU databases. T4PdM was able to achieve an overall accuracy of 99.98% and 98% for both datasets, respectively. In addition, the performance of the proposed model is compared to other previously published works. It has demonstrated the superiority of the model in detecting and classifying faults in rotating industrial machinery. Therefore, the proposed Transformer-based model can improve the performance of machinery fault analysis and diagnostic processes and leverage companies to a new era of the Industry 4.0. In addition, this methodology can be adapted to any other task of time series classification.",-24.79039,-3.8896697,0

However, automating a social media-based monitoring system is challenging—requiring advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning methods. In this paper, we describe the development and evaluation of automatic text classification models for detecting self-reports of PM abuse from Twitter. Methods We experimented with state-of-the-art bi-directional transformer-based language models, which utilize tweet-level representations that enable transfer learning (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, XLNet, AlBERT, and DistilBERT), proposed fusion-based approaches, and compared the developed models with several traditional machine learning, including deep learning, approaches. Using a public dataset, we evaluated the performances of the classifiers on their abilities to classify the non-majority “abuse/misuse” class. Results Our proposed fusion-based model performs significantly better than the best traditional model (F 1 -score [95% CI]: 0.67 [0.64–0.69] vs. 0.45 [0.42–0.48]). We illustrate, via experimentation using varying training set sizes, that the transformer-based models are more stable and require less annotated data compared to the other models.

This makes it more difficult to provide adequate primary care services, which include connecting patients to an appropriate medical specialist. A smartphone-compatible artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot that classifies patients’ symptoms and recommends the appropriate medical specialty could provide a valuable solution. Objective In order to establish a contactless method of recommending the appropriate medical specialty, this study aimed to construct a deep learning–based natural language processing (NLP) pipeline and to develop an AI chatbot that can be used on a smartphone. Methods We collected 118,008 sentences containing information on symptoms with labels (medical specialty), conducted data cleansing, and finally constructed a pipeline of 51,134 sentences for this study. Several deep learning models, including 4 different long short-term memory (LSTM) models with or without attention and with or without a pretrained FastText embedding layer, as well as bidirectional encoder representations from transformers for NLP, were trained and validated using a randomly selected test data set. The performance of the models was evaluated on the basis of the precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). An AI chatbot was also designed to make it easy for patients to use this specialty recommendation system. We used an open-source framework called “Alpha” to develop our AI chatbot. This takes the form of a web-based app with a frontend chat interface capable of conversing in text and a backend cloud-based server application to handle data collection, process the data with a deep learning model, and offer the medical specialty recommendation in a responsive web that is compatible with both desktops and smartphones. Results The bidirectional encoder representations from transformers model yielded the best performance, with an AUC of 0.964 and F1-score of 0.768, followed by LSTM model with embedding vectors, with an AUC of 0.965 and F1-score of 0.739. Considering the limitations of computing resources and the wide availability of smartphones, the LSTM model with embedding vectors trained on our data set was adopted for our AI chatbot service. We also deployed an Alpha version of the AI chatbot to be executed on both desktops and smartphones. Conclusions With the increasing need for telemedicine during the current COVID-19 pandemic, an AI chatbot with a deep learning–based NLP model that can recommend a medical specialty to patients through their smartphones would be exceedingly useful. This chatbot allows patients to identify the proper medical specialist in a rapid and contactless manner, based on their symptoms, thus potentially supporting both patients and primary care providers.","Medical Specialty Recommendations by an Artificial Intelligence Chatbot on a Smartphone: Development and Deployment.Background The COVID-19 pandemic has limited daily activities and even contact between patients and primary care providers.

An AI chatbot was also designed to make it easy for patients to use this specialty recommendation system. We used an open-source framework called “Alpha” to develop our AI chatbot. This takes the form of a web-based app with a frontend chat interface capable of conversing in text and a backend cloud-based server application to handle data collection, process the data with a deep learning model, and offer the medical specialty recommendation in a responsive web that is compatible with both desktops and smartphones. Results The bidirectional encoder representations from transformers model yielded the best performance, with an AUC of 0.964 and F1-score of 0.768, followed by LSTM model with embedding vectors, with an AUC of 0.965 and F1-score of 0.739. Considering the limitations of computing resources and the wide availability of smartphones, the LSTM model with embedding vectors trained on our data set was adopted for our AI chatbot service. We also deployed an Alpha version of the AI chatbot to be executed on both desktops and smartphones. Conclusions With the increasing need for telemedicine during the current COVID-19 pandemic, an AI chatbot with a deep learning–based NLP model that can recommend a medical specialty to patients through their smartphones would be exceedingly useful. This chatbot allows patients to identify the proper medical specialist in a rapid and contactless manner, based on their symptoms, thus potentially supporting both patients and primary care providers.",-30.732193,-14.752177,0

In this paper, we introduce a new scoring method that casts a plausibility ranking task in a full-text format and leverages the masked language modeling head tuned during the pre-training phase. We study commonsense reasoning tasks where the model must rank a set of hypotheses given a premise, focusing on the COPA, Swag, HellaSwag and CommonsenseQA datasets. By exploiting our scoring method without fine-tuning, we are able to produce strong baselines (e.g. 80% test accuracy on COPA) that are comparable to supervised approaches.

We argue that this fine-tuning procedure is sub-optimal as the pre-trained model has no prior on the specific classifier labels, while it might have already learned an intrinsic textual representation of the task. In this paper, we introduce a new scoring method that casts a plausibility ranking task in a full-text format and leverages the masked language modeling head tuned during the pre-training phase. We study commonsense reasoning tasks where the model must rank a set of hypotheses given a premise, focusing on the COPA, Swag, HellaSwag and CommonsenseQA datasets. By exploiting our scoring method without fine-tuning, we are able to produce strong baselines (e.g. 80% test accuracy on COPA) that are comparable to supervised approaches. Moreover, when fine-tuning directly on the proposed scoring function, we show that our method provides a much more stable training phase across random restarts (e.g x10 standard deviation reduction on COPA test accuracy) and requires less annotated data than the standard classifier approach to reach equivalent performances.",4.122563,22.010658,0

To tackle the training difficulty and enhance the spatio-temporal learning, we construct a shifted chunk Transformer with pure self-attention blocks. Leveraging the recent efficient Transformer design in NLP, this shifted chunk Transformer can learn hierarchical spatio-temporal features from a local tiny patch to a global video clip. Our shifted self-attention can also effectively model complicated inter-frame variances. Furthermore, we build a clip encoder based on Transformer to model long-term temporal dependencies. We conduct thorough ablation studies to validate each component and hyper-parameters in our shifted chunk Transformer, and it outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches on Kinetics-400, Kinetics-600, UCF101, and HMDB51.",-28.882458,21.93867,1

We leverage the ability of the transformer-based BERT model to generate contextualised embeddings capable of detecting semantic change of words across time. Several approaches are compared in a common setting in order to establish strengths and weaknesses for each of them. We also propose several ideas for improvements, managing to drastically improve the performance of existing approaches.",3.8037,5.376645,0

In this paper, we propose DA-Transformer, which is a distance-aware Transformer that can exploit the real distance. We propose to incorporate the real distances between tokens to re-scale the raw self-attention weights, which are computed by the relevance between attention query and key. Concretely, in different self-attention heads the relative distance between each pair of tokens is weighted by different learnable parameters, which control the different preferences on long- or short-term information of these heads. Since the raw weighted real distances may not be optimal for adjusting self-attention weights, we propose a learnable sigmoid function to map them into re-scaled coefficients that have proper ranges. We first clip the raw self-attention weights via the ReLU function to keep non-negativity and introduce sparsity, and then multiply them with the re-scaled coefficients to encode real distance information into self-attention.

Our code is available at https://github.com/mlpen/YOSO","You Only Sample (Almost) Once: Linear Cost Self-Attention Via Bernoulli Sampling.Transformer-based models are widely used in natural language processing (NLP). Central to the transformer model is the self-attention mechanism, which captures the interactions of token pairs in the input sequences and depends quadratically on the sequence length. Training such models on longer sequences is expensive. In this paper, we show that a Bernoulli sampling attention mechanism based on Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH), decreases the quadratic complexity of such models to linear. We bypass the quadratic cost by considering self-attention as a sum of individual tokens associated with Bernoulli random variables that can, in principle, be sampled at once by a single hash (although in practice, this number may be a small constant). This leads to an efficient sampling scheme to estimate self-attention which relies on specific modifications of LSH (to enable deployment on GPU architectures).

To this end, our models exploit computation using Quaternion algebra and hypercomplex spaces, enabling not only expressive inter-component interactions but also significantly (75%) reduced parameter size due to lesser degrees of freedom in the Hamilton product. We propose Quaternion variants of models, giving rise to new architectures such as the Quaternion attention Model and Quaternion Transformer. Extensive experiments on a battery of NLP tasks demonstrates the utility of proposed Quaternion-inspired models, enabling up to 75% reduction in parameter size without significant loss in performance.",7.449279,20.44402,1

Thus, it is imperative to develop solutions that can condense information while retaining its value. A step in this direction is measuring the semantic similarity between clinical text snippets. To address this problem, we participated in the 2019 National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2)/Open Health Natural Language Processing Consortium (OHNLP) clinical semantic textual similarity (ClinicalSTS) shared task. Objective This study aims to improve the performance and robustness of semantic textual similarity in the clinical domain by leveraging manually labeled data from related tasks and contextualized embeddings from pretrained transformer-based language models. Methods The ClinicalSTS data set consists of 1642 pairs of deidentified clinical text snippets annotated in a continuous scale of 0-5, indicating degrees of semantic similarity. We developed an iterative intermediate training approach using multi-task learning (IIT-MTL), a multi-task training approach that employs iterative data set selection. We applied this process to bidirectional encoder representations from transformers on clinical text mining (ClinicalBERT), a pretrained domain-specific transformer-based language model, and fine-tuned the resulting model on the target ClinicalSTS task. We incrementally ensembled the output from applying IIT-MTL on ClinicalBERT with the output of other language models (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers for biomedical text mining [BioBERT], multi-task deep neural networks [MT-DNN], and robustly optimized BERT approach [RoBERTa]) and handcrafted features using regression-based learning algorithms. On the basis of these experiments, we adopted the top-performing configurations as our official submissions. Results Our system ranked first out of 87 submitted systems in the 2019 n2c2/OHNLP ClinicalSTS challenge, achieving state-of-the-art results with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.9010.

Conclusions This study demonstrates that IIT-MTL is an effective way to leverage annotated data from related tasks to improve performance on a target task with a limited data set.

Diagnostic (International Classification of Diseases [ICD]) codes are often used in studies using electronic health records (EHRs), but they are inaccurate. Objective We sought to develop a more accurate method using natural language processing (NLP) to detect delirium episodes on the basis of unstructured clinical notes. Methods We collected 1.5 million notes from >10,000 patients from among 9 hospitals. Seven experts iteratively labeled 200,471 sentences. Using these, we trained three NLP classifiers: Support Vector Machine, Recurrent Neural Networks, and Transformer. Testing was performed using an external data set. We also evaluated associations with delirium billing (ICD) codes, medications, orders for restraints and sitters, direct assessments (Confusion Assessment Method [CAM] scores), and in-hospital mortality. F1 scores, confusion matrices, and areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) were used to compare NLP models. We used the φ coefficient to measure associations with other delirium indicators. Results The transformer NLP performed best on the following parameters: micro F1=0.978, macro F1=0.918, positive AUC=0.984, and negative AUC=0.992. NLP detections exhibited higher correlations (φ) than ICD codes with deliriogenic medications (0.194 vs 0.073 for ICD codes), restraints and sitter orders (0.358 vs 0.177), mortality (0.216 vs 0.000), and CAM scores (0.256 vs –0.028). Conclusions Clinical notes are an attractive alternative to ICD codes for EHR delirium studies but require automated methods.

We first introduce the segment-aware mechanism to Transformer-XL, which is a popular Transformer-based language model with memory extension and relative position encoding. We find that our method can further improve the Transformer-XL base model and large model, achieving 17.1 perplexity on the WikiText-103 dataset. We further investigate the pre-training masked language modeling task with Segatron. Experimental results show that BERT pre-trained with Segatron (SegaBERT) can outperform BERT with vanilla Transformer on various NLP tasks, and outperforms RoBERTa on zero-shot sentence representation learning.

Nearly all state-of-the-art language models and pre-trained language models are based on the Transformer architecture. However, it distinguishes sequential tokens only with the token position index.

To effectively harness such rich information, we propose multi-headed global cross-covariance pooling with singular value power normalization, which shares similar philosophy and thus is compatible with the transformer block, better than commonly used pooling methods. Then, we study comprehensively how to explicitly combine word tokens with classification token for building the final classification head. For CV tasks, our SoT significantly improves state-of-the-art vision transformers on challenging benchmarks including ImageNet and ImageNet-A. For NLP tasks, through fine-tuning based on pretrained language transformers including GPT and BERT, our SoT greatly boosts the performance on widely used tasks such as CoLA and RTE.

Despite great advance, most of works only focus on improvement of architectures but pay little attention to the classification head. For years transformer models base exclusively on classification token to construct the final classifier, without explicitly harnessing high-level word tokens.

In this work, we present AVLTrack, a flexible framework for aerial vision-language tracking. It consists of three key components, a dynamic sparse learning (DSL) module, an efficient Transformer backbone, and a multi-level language perception (MLP) strategy. First, DSL sparsely connects language and images via dynamic sparse attention, providing accurate multi-modal prompts. To adapt to target state variations, the sparsity in DSL is dynamically adjusted based on semantic information, flexibly highlighting target-specific tokens. Next, the Transformer backbone follows highly parallelized one-stream architectures, allowing efficient multi-modal feature extraction and interaction. Finally, MLP enables the iterative interaction of language and visual information, aiming to utilize language priori to guide the generation of discriminative visual features.

Extensive experiments on WebUAV-3M and DTB70-NLP demonstrate the leading performance of AVLTrack compared to existing outstanding trackers while maintaining a high running speed of 80.5 FPS.

We observed a constant usage of these emojis to represent offensiveness throughout different timespans on Twitter. We manually annotate and publicly release the largest Arabic dataset for offensive, fine-grained hate speech, vulgar, and violence content. Furthermore, we benchmark the dataset for detecting offensiveness and hate speech using different transformer architectures and perform in-depth linguistic analysis.

Competitive results on these datasets suggest that the data collected using our method capture universal characteristics of offensive language. Our findings also highlight the common words used in offensive communications, common targets for hate speech, specific patterns in violence tweets, and pinpoint common classification errors that can be attributed to limitations of NLP models.

If successful, web-based mental health conversations could improve access to treatment and reduce the global disease burden. Psychologists have repeatedly demonstrated that empathy, the ability to understand and feel the emotions and experiences of others, is a key component leading to positive outcomes in supportive conversations. However, recent studies have shown that highly empathic conversations are rare in online mental health platforms. In this paper, we work towards improving empathy in online mental health support conversations. We introduce a new task of empathic rewriting which aims to transform low-empathy conversational posts to higher empathy. Learning such transformations is challenging and requires a deep understanding of empathy while maintaining conversation quality through text fluency and specificity to the conversational context. Here we propose Partner, a deep reinforcement learning (RL) agent that learns to make sentence-level edits to posts in order to increase the expressed level of empathy while maintaining conversation quality. Our RL agent leverages a policy network, based on a transformer language model adapted from GPT-2, which performs the dual task of generating candidate empathic sentences and adding those sentences at appropriate positions. During training, we reward transformations that increase empathy in posts while maintaining text fluency, context specificity, and diversity. Through a combination of automatic and human evaluation, we demonstrate that Partner successfully generates more empathic, specific, and diverse responses and outperforms NLP methods from related tasks such as style transfer and empathic dialogue generation.

Interestingly, in the absence of enough clinical data to train a model from scratch, we applied mixed-domain pretraining and cross-domain transfer approaches to generate a performant bio-clinical model suitable for real-world clinical data. We evaluated our models on Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks for biomedical documents and challenging hospital discharge reports. When compared against the competitive mBERT and BETO models, we outperform them in all NER tasks by a significant margin.

Interestingly, in the absence of enough clinical data to train a model from scratch, we applied mixed-domain pretraining and cross-domain transfer approaches to generate a performant bio-clinical model suitable for real-world clinical data. We evaluated our models on Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks for biomedical documents and challenging hospital discharge reports. When compared against the competitive mBERT and BETO models, we outperform them in all NER tasks by a significant margin. Finally, we studied the impact of the model's vocabulary on the NER performances by offering an interesting vocabulary-centric analysis.

We answer this question by presenting RPT, a denoising auto-encoder for tuple-to-X models (X could be tuple, token, label, JSON, and so on). RPT is pre-trained for a tuple-to-tuple model by corrupting the input tuple and then learning a model to reconstruct the original tuple. It adopts a Transformer-based neural translation architecture that consists of a bidirectional encoder (similar to BERT) and a left-to-right autoregressive decoder (similar to GPT), leading to a generalization of both BERT and GPT. The pre-trained RPT can already support several common data preparation tasks such as data cleaning, auto-completion and schema matching. Better still, RPT can be fine-tuned on a wide range of data preparation tasks, such as value normalization, data transformation, data annotation, etc. To complement RPT, we also discuss several appealing techniques such as collaborative training and few-shot learning for entity resolution, and few-shot learning and NLP question-answering for information extraction.

To facilitate automated screening, free-text eligibility criteria must be structured and coded into a computable format using controlled vocabularies.
